Above are homework assignments and a final project I have completed individually. I did discuss some specific questions with peers but did the coding individually.
Course: Python Coding for Public Policy
Term: fall 2022
Professor: Aidan Feldman (https://wagner.nyu.edu/community/faculty/aidan-feldman)
Please don't use the code unethically.
